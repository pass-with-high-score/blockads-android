🤔 FAQ
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ Is BlockAds safe?
✅ Completely safe! The app only filters DNS queries locally to block ads. No personal data is intercepted or transmitted.

❓ Why does it need VPN permission?
✅ BlockAds creates a local VPN tunnel on your device to filter DNS requests. No data is sent to external servers — everything stays on your phone.

❓ Does it work with all apps?
✅ Yes! BlockAds works system-wide across all apps, browsers, and games. You can also whitelist specific apps if needed.

❓ Is it really free?
✅ 100% free, no ads inside the app, no in-app purchases, and open source!

❓ Will it slow down my internet?
✅ No. BlockAds only processes DNS queries (tiny packets), so there's virtually no impact on speed or battery life.
