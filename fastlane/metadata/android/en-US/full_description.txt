FAQ
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Is BlockAds safe?
Yes. BlockAds only filters DNS queries locally to block ads. No personal data is intercepted or transmitted.

Why does it need VPN permission?
BlockAds creates a local VPN tunnel on your device to filter DNS requests. No data is sent to external servers — everything stays on your phone.

Does it work with all apps?
Yes. BlockAds works system-wide across all apps, browsers, and games. You can also whitelist specific apps if needed.

Is it really free?
Yes. BlockAds is 100% free, with no ads inside the app, no in-app purchases, and it is open source.

Will it slow down my internet?
No. BlockAds only processes DNS queries, which are very small, so there is virtually no impact on speed or battery life.
